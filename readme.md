This project is a radio alarm app for iOS 9+.

Apple doesn't seem to want to let a radio alarm that works the way I want it through into the App Store. I want a radio alarm that wakes me up without having to have the screen on all night.

I also think that most of the UIs for the existing radio alarm clocks suck; they insist on being a clock, even though for my usage, they are never really visible.
